Known bugs in Dia
=================

This document describes some known bugs in this version of Dia.	If you
have a fix for any of these bugs please contact me.

* On Linux Alpha we need to link to -mieee or Dia segfaults on
startup. This is done by some magic in configure.in. This is probably
due to some strange floating point exception stuff thats not supposed
to happen. Dia shouldn't really need strict IEEE compliance, and the
Alpha version would run faster if this were fixed correctly instead of
worked around. Alas, i don't have access to any Linux Alpha machines,
so i can't fix this.

* Keyboard accels must be disabled whilst dragging an object or
handle, else stuff can crash easily by deleting (Ctrl-X) while dragging.

* The FS objects don't support undo. They also use menus in a non-standard
way. They have to be cleaned up some day.

* Entering an erronous command as print command crashes dia when
printing. This is due to writing to the broken pipe. How can this be
caught and handled?

* Strings with only spaces in them seems to get zero width. Most
  visible on an "UML - Note".

* Toggling rulers changes the size of the window to the default size.
  I don't know how this can be fixed.

* Changing arrow properties on a line and then double-clicking on
  another line sometimes crashes Dia.
  
* "UML - Aggregate" lays out the text at the endpoint pretty
  bad. It collides with the diamond and arrows.
